# docker
Self-Contained Docker C# Blazor Web API host

There are currently four (5) repositories. This is the repository that is an ASP.NET server and contains the entire codebase as a submodule.

Most likely you're looking for https://github.com/The-Revolution-Network/viva or https://github.com/The-Revolution-Network/docker

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:The-Revolution-Network/docker.git TheRevolutionNetwork.docker
```

generally the submodules are equivalent with the master branch of each repo, you usually can git checkout master in each submodule and have no changes.
